# Task-Manager-LWC
To build a Task Manager in Lightning Web Components (LWC) for managing tasks, orders, or approvals, you can create a custom component that integrates with Salesforceâ€™s standard Task object or custom objects for orders and approvals. This component will allow users to view, create, update, and manage these records directly from the component.
